# Chat-Li

**Chat-Li** is a CLI that allows users to communicate via the terminal. Users will be able to create accounts as well as rooms by using the **Chat-Li** API. After this they can use the CLI to chat with other users connected to the same room. Be a command line hero with **Chat-Li** and enjoy communicating with friends in a new exciting, and colorful, way!

Original idea and initial code comes from a [team project](https://github.com/Chat-LI/Chat-LI-Client) I worked on while at a coding bootcamp.

This is my progression of the application so I can learn new technologies and implement new features.
